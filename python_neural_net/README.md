## Overview

This directory is a stripped-down version of Michal Dobranksi's [super-simple Python implementation](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython/tree/master) of DNN training on MNIST.

Its eventual purpose is to test the accuracy & speed of my tensor processing library. But for now, I'll keep it separate.

To run, simple do `python3 train.py`.
